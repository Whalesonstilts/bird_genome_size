# Bird Genome Size Project :bird:

**Background**

Variation in animal genome size is a difficult subject to study. The primary issue arises in determining the accuracy of existing methods of estimating size. The method used for many years was based around measuring the size of the nuclei of somatic cells. Genome size is also measured by quantifying the amount of DNA in a cell using approaches like flow cytometry and feulgen density. A more modern approach is to use assembly length, but this method has a tendency to erroneously reduce genome size due to SSRs throughout the genome no being properly aligned.
